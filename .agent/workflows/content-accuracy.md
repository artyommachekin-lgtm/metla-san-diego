description: MANDATORY TRUTH & LEGAL CHECK. Must be used to verify service inclusions, pricing, and strictly prevent liability risks (e.g., promising deposit returns) before generating any text.

## Content Accuracy Requirements

Before publishing any blog content that references services, pricing, or what's included, **ALWAYS verify against the source of truth:**

1. **Service Definitions:** Check `constants.ts` → `SERVICES` array
2. **Pricing:** Check `constants.ts` for any pricing data
3. **Locations:** Check `constants.ts` → `LOCATIONS` array

## ⚠️ LEGAL RISK: No Over-Promising

**NEVER make guarantees or promises about outcomes the company cannot control.**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Language:
- "Get your deposit back"
- "Ensure you get your deposit"
- "Guarantee your deposit return"
- "We promise X results"
- "100% guaranteed"
- "Will eliminate [problem]"
- Any language that implies a specific outcome

### ✅ SAFE Language:
- "**Maximize your chances** of getting your deposit back"
- "**Help improve** your chances of deposit return"
- "**Designed to meet** property management standards"
- "**Can significantly improve** your chances"
- "Our cleaning **helps satisfy** lease requirements"

### Why This Matters:
Deposits are determined by landlords, not cleaning companies. Promising outcomes we can't control creates **legal liability**. If a customer doesn't get their deposit back after we "guaranteed" it, they could sue.

## Verification Checklist

Before publishing any content:

1. [ ] **Service inclusions verified** against `constants.ts` checklist
2. [ ] **No guarantee language** (deposit, results, outcomes)
3. [ ] **Pricing matches** current rates (or uses ranges)
4. [ ] **Location references** are accurate (San Diego, not Miami)
5. [ ] **Add-ons clearly labeled** as additional cost

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Saying "inside oven/fridge cleaning" is included in deep clean (it's NOT)
- ❌ Claiming "get your deposit back" (legal risk)
- ❌ Promising specific outcomes we can't control
- ❌ Window cleaning is included (only sills, not glass, in deep clean)
- ❌ Mixing up what's included in different service tiers

## ⚠️ OPERATIONAL REALITY (The "1099 Constraint")
**Context:** We utilize a network of independent domestic workers (1099 contractors). While vetted professionals, equipment varies between teams.

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Equipment & Process Claims:
* **NO HEPA Promises:** Do NOT say "We use HEPA filters" or "We use Dyson vacuums." Say: "Professional-grade vacuums."
* **NO Chemical Promises:** Do NOT say "We spray anti-microbial solution" as a standard step.
* **NO Grout Restoration:** Do NOT say "We scrub grout lines," "We whiten grout," or "We restore tile" in a standard description.

### ✅ CORRECT "Add-On" Phrasing:
* **Floors & Grout:**
    * *Standard:* "We vacuum and mop all hard floors to remove surface dust and dirt."
    * *Add-On:* "Deep grout scrubbing and tile restoration is available as a **specialized add-on** request."
* **Mold/Mildew:**
    * *Standard:* "We clean accessible surfaces."
    * *Add-On:* "Treating deep-set mildew or humidity buildup requires a specific **Deep Clean Add-On**."
* **Allergies:** Focus on *dust removal*, not *air purification*.
    * *Say:* "Our detailed dusting protocols help reduce allergens in the home."

### 🛑 The "Scope of Work" Rule:
* If a task requires a ladder higher than 2 steps, it is **FORBIDDEN**.
* If a task requires moving furniture heavier than 25lbs, it is **FORBIDDEN**.
