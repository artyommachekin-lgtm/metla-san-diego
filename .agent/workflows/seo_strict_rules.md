# SEO, AI-Overview & GEO Strategy

## 1. GEO Optimization (Hyper-Local Authority)
To rank in the "Local Pack" and Maps, every page must prove physical relevance:
* **The "Micro-Location" Rule:** Do not just say "San Diego." You MUST mention:
    * **2 Specific Landmarks:** (e.g., "Minutes from Balboa Park" or "Near the UTC Mall").
    * **Specific Intersection/Access:** (e.g., "Easily accessible via I-5 and Garnet Ave").
    * **Nearby Neighborhoods:** "Also serving adjacent areas like [Neighbor A] and [Neighbor B]."
* **Local Vernacular:** Use terms locals use.
    * *Miami:* "Biscayne Bay view," "Humidity control," "Seasonal residents."
    * *San Diego:* "Marine layer," "Santa Ana winds dust," "Canyon breeze."

## 2. AI SEO (Optimizing for Gemini/ChatGPT Answers)
To get cited by AI models, you must provide "snippable" answers:
* **The "Direct Answer" Rule:** The FIRST sentence under any H2 header must be a direct, factual answer to the question.
    * *Bad:* "When considering the cost of a deep clean, there are many variables..."
    * *Good:* "A deep clean for a 2-bedroom home in North Park typically ranges from $300 to $450, depending on square footage."
* **Structure:** Use **Bullet Points** and **Bolded Key Terms**. AI models read structure easier than dense paragraphs.
* **Q&A Format:** Include a "Frequently Asked Questions about [Neighborhood] Cleaning" section at the bottom.

## 3. Standard Technical SEO
* **H1 Tag:** Must be "[Service Keyword] in [City/Neighborhood]" (e.g., "House Cleaning North Park: Reliable & Detailed").
* **Title Tag:** [Main Keyword] | [Neighborhood] | Metla Cleaning
* **Meta Description:** Start with a verb. Answer the "Why us?" question immediately. Max 155 chars.

## 4. Internal Linking (The "Spider Web")
* **Service Clusters:** If the page is about "Move-Outs," link to the "Deep Clean" page as a related service.
* **Geo Clusters:** Link to the *main* city page (e.g., "Back to all San Diego Locations").

## 5. Duplicate Content Prevention (The "Anti-Zombie" Protocol)
To prevent "Doorway Page" penalties, you MUST vary the structure of every page.
**Rule:** For each new page, randomly select ONE of the following "Narrative Hooks" for the Introduction:

* **Hook A (The "Local Pain" Angle):**
    * *Start:* Immediately address the specific environmental problem of that neighborhood (e.g., "Living in **Pacific Beach** means battling constant salt spray and sand...").
    * *Focus:* Technical cleaning details, rust prevention, humidity control.
* **Hook B (The "Lifestyle" Angle):**
    * *Start:* Focus on what the client should be doing instead of cleaning (e.g., "You moved to **Little Italy** for the food, not to spend Saturday scrubbing floors...").
    * *Focus:* Time-saving, convenience, enjoying the local amenities.
* **Hook C (The "Real Estate" Angle):**
    * *Start:* Focus on the property value and investment (e.g., "Protecting your **La Jolla** investment requires more than a casual dust...").
    * *Focus:* Maintenance, long-term value, protecting finishes.

**Constraint:** You cannot use the same Hook for two consecutive pages.

## 7. Internal Link Audit Protocol (The "Spider Web" Strategy)
**Objective:** Distribute PageRank authority and prevent "Orphan Pages."
**Trigger:** When asked to "Audit Links" or "Build Internal Links," execute the following checks:

### 1. The "Hub & Spoke" Check
* **Rule:** Every Neighborhood Page (e.g., *North Park*) MUST link back to the Main City Hub (e.g., *San Diego Cleaning Services*).
* **Format:** "Proudly serving the greater [Link: San Diego] area."

### 2. The "Problem -> Solution" Service Link
* **Rule:** Scan the text for specific cleaning problems and link to the matching Service Page.
    * *Text:* "We remove deep-set dust..." -> *Link:* `/services/deep-cleaning`
    * *Text:* "Getting your deposit back..." -> *Link:* `/services/move-in-out`
    * *Text:* "Vacation rental turnover..." -> *Link:* `/services/airbnb-cleaning`

### 3. The "Educational" Blog Link
* **Rule:** If the content mentions a specific tip (e.g., "Mold prevention" or "Pet hair"), link to a relevant Blog Post if one exists in the project.
    * *Example:* "For more tips on maintenance, read our guide on [Controlling Coastal Mold](/blog/mold-guide)."

### 4. The "Orphan" Prevention Count
* **Requirement:** Every single page MUST have at least **3 Internal Links**:
    1.  **Up:** To the City Hub.
    2.  **Sideways:** To a related Service or Blog.
    3.  **Conversion:** To the `/booking` page (CTA).
