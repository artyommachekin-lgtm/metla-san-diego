## Image Requirements for Blog Posts

1. **Unique Images**: Every blog post MUST have a unique hero/thumbnail image. Never reuse the same Unsplash URL across multiple posts.

2. **Relevant Images**: The image must directly relate to the blog post topic:
   - Ceiling fans article → image of a ceiling fan
   - Granite counters article → image of granite countertops
   - Upholstery cleaning → image of a sofa/couch
   - Mold removal → image related to cleaning/mold
   - Refrigerator → image of a refrigerator

3. **Image Source**: Use Unsplash for high-quality, free stock images. Format:
   ```
   https://images.unsplash.com/photo-ID?q=80&w=800&fm=webp
   ```

4. **Before Adding New Blog Posts**: Verify that the image URL is not already used in the `BLOG_POSTS` array in `BlogPage.tsx`.
