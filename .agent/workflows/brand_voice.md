# Metla House Cleaning - Brand Voice & Tone

## 1. Core Identity
* **Who We Are:** A versatile, high-performance cleaning partner for San Diego and Miami.
* **Audience:** Residential homeowners (Trust/Health) & Property Managers (Speed/Reliability).
* **Archetype:** "The Professional Solver." We don't just clean; we solve the turnover problem.

## 2. Tone of Voice
* **Direct & Active:** "We scrub the floors" (Good) vs "Floors are scrubbed by us" (Bad).
* **Confident but Realistic:** We don't promise magic; we promise hard work and systems.
* **Warm but Professional:** Friendly enough for a family, organized enough for a property developer.

## 3. The "Anti-AI" Filter (Strict Constraints)
**Do NOT use these robotic words:**
* "Delve," "Elevate," "Unlock," "Tapestry," "Landscape," "Game-changer," "Revolutionize."
* "Hidden gem," "Look no further," "In today's fast-paced world," "Top-notch."

## 4. Key Differentiators to Highlight
* **Flexibility:** "Eco-friendly" for families, "Industrial-strength" for nasty turnovers.
* **Reliability:** We show up. We have systems. We are not a gig-app.
